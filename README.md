- Render mockup books as cards and add functionality to said cards
- Modal or another sidebar with more card info
- Implement dragging and dropping (?)
- Make an actual API call to Google Books, Goodreads, or Open Library
- Replace mockup login functionality with Firebase integration
  - Actually understand how Firebase works
